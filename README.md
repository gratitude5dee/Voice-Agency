## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or newer)
-   A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   **Supabase Account**: To store waitlist data. [Sign up here](https://supabase.com/).
-   **ElevenLabs API Key**: For the voice AI functionality. [Get a key here](https://elevenlabs.io/).

### ‚ö° Quick Start

For a fast setup, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awaken-galaxy-voice-30-main.git
cd awaken-galaxy-voice-30-main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Fill in your API keys in the .env file

# 5. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and add your Supabase and ElevenLabs credentials.

```env
# Get from your Supabase project settings
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-url.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Get from your ElevenLabs account
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-elevenlabs-api-key"
```

> **Note**: For the Supabase integration to work, you will need to create two tables in your Supabase project: `waitlist` and `contact_sales`. You can find the required schema in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` or use the SQL definitions below:
>
> ```sql
> -- Waitlist Table
> CREATE TABLE waitlist (
>   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
>   name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
>   referral_code TEXT,
>   skip_waitlist BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
>   created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
> );
>
> -- Contact Sales Table
> CREATE TABLE contact_sales (
>   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
>   name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   email TEXT NOT NULL,
>   company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   phone_number TEXT,
>   message TEXT,
>   created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
> );
> ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore its features:

-   **Activate the Voice Agent**: Click the "Activate Voice AI" button to start the microphone.
-   **Interact with the AI**: Speak into your microphone. The AI will respond, and the 3D waveform will react to the audio.
-   **Join the Waitlist**: Scroll down to the waitlist form to sign up for early access.
-   **Explore the UI**: Enjoy the smooth animations and the galaxy-themed design.

## ‚úÖ Testing

This project does not have an automated testing suite. Adding tests with a framework like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) would be a valuable contribution.

A basic test script can be added to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "test": "vitest"
}
```

## üö¢ Deployment

The application can be deployed as a static site to any modern hosting provider.

1.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized, production-ready build in the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Deploy**:
    Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to a platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

    **Important**: Remember to set your environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) in your hosting provider's dashboard.

## ü§ù Contributing

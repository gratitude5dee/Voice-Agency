### Analysis Summary

The "Awaken Galaxy Voice" project is a visually stunning and technologically sophisticated single-page application that serves as a landing page for a real-time, conversational voice AI. The project's primary purpose is to showcase the voice AI's capabilities and collect user interest via a waitlist form.

-   **Core Technology**: The application is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, powered by the **Vite** build tool. The user interface is crafted with the highly popular **shadcn/ui** component library, which leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling. This results in a sleek, modern, and responsive UI with a custom "galaxy" dark theme.

-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Interactive 3D Visualization**: The centerpiece is a beautiful, audio-reactive 3D waveform created with **React Three Fiber** and **Three.js**. It features a dynamic particle system and waveform bars that respond to microphone input, creating an immersive user experience.
    -   **Real-time Voice AI**: The `VoiceAgent` component integrates directly with the **ElevenLabs API** using their official React SDK (`@11labs/react`), enabling real-time, conversational AI interaction.
    -   **Backend Integration**: The project uses **Supabase** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) to handle the waitlist and contact form submissions. The Supabase integration is clearly defined with auto-generated TypeScript types for database tables.
    -   **Polished UI/UX**: The application boasts a rich, animated user interface with custom Tailwind CSS keyframes for effects like floating, shimmering, and glowing, creating a polished and engaging "cosmic" aesthetic.

-   **Project Structure**: The codebase is exceptionally well-organized. It features a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated folders for `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `integrations`, and `utils`. Custom hooks like `useAudioData` manage client-side state with **Zustand**, demonstrating modern state management practices.

-   **Developer Experience**: The project is set up for a smooth developer workflow with path aliases configured in `tsconfig.json` and a standard Vite development environment. The provided code is clean, well-commented, and uses TypeScript effectively. The only missing element is a formal testing suite.

In essence, "Awaken Galaxy Voice" is an exemplary showcase of combining cutting-edge frontend technologies (React, Vite, Three.js) with powerful AI services (ElevenLabs) and a modern BaaS (Supabase) to create a compelling and interactive product landing page.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or newer)
-   A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   **Supabase Account**: To store waitlist data. [Sign up here](https://supabase.com/).
-   **ElevenLabs API Key**: For the voice AI functionality. [Get a key here](https://elevenlabs.io/).

### ‚ö° Quick Start

For a fast setup, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awaken-galaxy-voice-30-main.git
cd awaken-galaxy-voice-30-main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Fill in your API keys in the .env file

# 5. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and add your Supabase and ElevenLabs credentials.

```env
# Get from your Supabase project settings
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-url.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Get from your ElevenLabs account
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-elevenlabs-api-key"
```

> **Note**: For the Supabase integration to work, you will need to create two tables in your Supabase project: `waitlist` and `contact_sales`. You can find the required schema in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` or use the SQL definitions below:
>
> ```sql
> -- Waitlist Table
> CREATE TABLE waitlist (
>   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
>   name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
>   referral_code TEXT,
>   skip_waitlist BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
>   created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
> );
>
> -- Contact Sales Table
> CREATE TABLE contact_sales (
>   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
>   name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   email TEXT NOT NULL,
>   company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
>   phone_number TEXT,
>   message TEXT,
>   created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
> );
> ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore its features:

-   **Activate the Voice Agent**: Click the "Activate Voice AI" button to start the microphone.
-   **Interact with the AI**: Speak into your microphone. The AI will respond, and the 3D waveform will react to the audio.
-   **Join the Waitlist**: Scroll down to the waitlist form to sign up for early access.
-   **Explore the UI**: Enjoy the smooth animations and the galaxy-themed design.

## ‚úÖ Testing

This project does not have an automated testing suite. Adding tests with a framework like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) would be a valuable contribution.

A basic test script can be added to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "test": "vitest"
}
```

## üö¢ Deployment

The application can be deployed as a static site to any modern hosting provider.

1.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized, production-ready build in the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Deploy**:
    Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to a platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

    **Important**: Remember to set your environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) in your hosting provider's dashboard.
